    <p>I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms</p>

    <p>If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it</p>
    <p>I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly</p>

    <p>Hey, I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms</p>

    <p>If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it</p>
    <p>I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly</p>

    <p>Hey, I believe in me, oh</p>

    <p>If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it</p>
    <p>I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly</p>

    <p>Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Fly</p>
